My blogposts from dublinopinion.com 2006-2010

DublinOpinion was a blog run by my friend Donagh Brennan from October 2006 to December 2017. It covered a range of topics on music, culture, and politics in Ireland, with a contributing roster of writers. My tuppence was 24 blogposts on cultural topics, mostly music and gigs in Dublin. The website went offline at some point and I had given it up for lost until randomly finding it completely by accident on the wayback machine in January 2024. This repo, therefore is an archive of my personal portion of the late, great dublinopinion.com. 

The original website is now 404 but used to be on [dublinopinion](https://dublinopinion.com).

As far as I can tell, most of the content is still available on the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20171221233435/http://dublinopinion.com/).
